        <h2>Tech Goals</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Become a well-rounded web developer: Over the next two years, I want
            to significantly improve my web development skills. This includes
            becoming more proficient in JavaScript (including ES6+ features) and
            React, while also learning additional frameworks to expand my
            toolkit.
          </li>
          <li>
            Master multiple areas of web development: I'm aiming to become an
            expert in web development, not just in one area, but across many!
            This includes front-end development, back-end development,
            full-stack development, UX/UI design, and accessibility.
          </li>
          <li>
            Deepen my technical expertise: Even beyond core languages and
            frameworks, I want to focus on mastering a specific technical area.
            Whether it's performance optimization, security, or testing, I'll
            choose an area to become highly skilled in.
          </li>
          <li>
            Network and stay up-to-date: To stay relevant and connected in the
            industry, I'll actively participate in web development conferences
            and meetups. This will allow me to learn about new technologies,
            network with other developers, and stay on top of the latest trends.
          </li>
          <li>Have a good tech paying job:</li>
